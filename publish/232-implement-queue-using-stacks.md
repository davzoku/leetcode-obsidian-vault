title: 232 Implement Queue using Stack - Easy

## Problem:
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

- You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
**Output**
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

**Explanation**
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= x <= 9`
- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **[amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)** `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity:**
    - `push(x)`: O(1) - Appending an element to the end of a list in Python has constant time complexity on average.
    - `pop()`: O(n) - Removing the first element from a list requires shifting all remaining elements to fill the gap. This results in linear time complexity, where "n" is the number of elements in the list.
    - `peek()`: O(1) - Accessing the first element of the list is a constant time operation.
    - `empty()`: O(1) - Checking the length of the list and comparing it with 0 is a constant time operation.
2. **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is O(n), where "n" is the number of elements in the queue. This is because the elements are stored in a list.

## Solutions:

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.queue.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.queue.pop(0)
        

    def peek(self) -> int:
        return self.queue[0]
        

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.queue) == 0


# Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyQueue()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.peek()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```
