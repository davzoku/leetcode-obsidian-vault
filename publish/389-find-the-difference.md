## Problem:
You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
**Output:** "e"
**Explanation:** 'e' is the letter that was added.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "", t = "y"
**Output:** "y"

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Problem Analysis:
- Let n be the length of the longer string between `s` and `t`.
- Constructing the counters (`Counter(s)` and `Counter(t)`) takes O(n) time and space.
- Calculating the difference (`Counter(t) - Counter(s)`) also takes O(n) time and space.
- Accessing the keys of the resulting counter and returning the first key takes constant time, so it's O(1).
- Therefore, the overall time and space complexity is O(n).
## Solutions:

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        counter1 = Counter(s)
        counter2 = Counter(t)
        return [x for x in (Counter(t) - Counter(s)).keys()][0]
        # res = list(Counter(t) - Counter(s)).keys())
        # return res[0]
```
