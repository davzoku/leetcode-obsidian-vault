# Leetcode Obsidian Vault

_A Customizable Obsidian Publish alternative using Next.JS forked from [matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter](https://github.com/matthewwong525/linked-blog-starter-md)_

This repository contains the obsidian vault note aka content for the Next.js frontend, [davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-frontend](https://github.com/davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-frontend).

The steps to publish a similar website is shown in this original [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKSpK1dXn4E).

## Deviations

Matthew published the website on Vercel, while I published it on Netlify. This is a personal choice and it can be done easily by changing the final GitHub Action step, "Deploy to Vercel" or "Deploy to Netlify" in [publish.yml](https://github.com/davzoku/leetcode-obsidian-vault/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml).
